Mac

i. See what the default is (mac comes with ruby installed by default - i didnt know this):

$ ruby -v
... 2.3.7 ...

1. Install Xcode

$ xcode-select --install

2. Make sure to agree to the license

$ sudo xcodebuild -license

3. Install version 2.3.3

$ rvm install 2.3.3

4. Make 2.3.3 the default

$ rvm --default use 2.3.3

5. reboot

6. check 2.3.3 is now the default (was 2.3.7)

$ ruby -v
... 2.3.3p222  ...

(I didnt need to do this, it seemed to nuke 2.3.7 which was installed by default.)

7. Generate the docs

$ rvm docs generate-ri
